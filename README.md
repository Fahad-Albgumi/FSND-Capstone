# FSND: Capstone Project

## Covered Topics

This is the last project of the `Udacity-Full-Stack-Nanodegree` Course. It covers following technical topics in 1 app:

1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy` (see `models.py`)
2. API to performance CRUD Operations on database with `Flask` (see `app.py`)
3. Automated testing with `Unittest` (see `test_app`)
4. Authorization & Role based Authentification with `Auth0` (see `auth.py`)
5. Deployment on `Heroku`



## Start Project locally

Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder (with all app files) before following the setup steps. Also, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine.

To start and run the local development server,

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:

```
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env_capstone
$ source env_capstone/scripts/activate
```

1. Install the dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running this project locally means that it can´t access `Herokus` env variables. To fix this, you need to edit a few informations in `config.py`, so it can correctly connect to a local database

1. Change database config so it can connect to your local postgres database

- Open `config.py` with your editor of choice.
- Here you can see this dict:

```
database_setup = {
   "database_name_production" : "agency",
   "user_name" : "postgres", # default postgres user name
   "password" : "testpassword123", # if applicable. If no password, just type in None
   "port" : "localhost:5432" # default postgres port
}
```

- Just change `user_name`, `password` and `port` to whatever you choose while installing postgres.

> *tip*: `user_name` usually defaults to `postgres` and `port` always defaults to `localhost:5432` while installing postgres, most of the time you just need to change the `password`.

1. Setup Auth0 If you only want to test the API (i.e. Project Reviewer), you can simply take the existing bearer tokens in `config.py`.

If you already know your way around `Auth0`, just insert your data into `config.py` => auth0_config.

FYI: Here are the steps I followed to enable authentication:

1. Run the development server:

```
$ python app.py
```

1. (optional) To execute tests, run

```
$ python test_app.py
```

If you choose to run all tests, it should give this response if everything went fine:

```
$ python test_app.py
.........................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 25 tests in 18.132s

OK
```

# 

## Authentication

All API Endpoints are decorated with Auth0 permissions. To use the project locally, you need to config Auth0 accordingly

### Auth0 for locally use

#### Create an App & API

1. Login to https://manage.auth0.com/
2. Click on Applications Tab
3. Create Application
4. Give it a name like `Music` and select "Regular Web Application"
5. Go to Settings and find `domain`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['AUTH0_DOMAIN'] (i.e. replace `"dev-qgzdp5vm.eu.auth0.com"`)
6. Click on API Tab
7. Create a new API:
   1. Name: `Music`
   2. Identifier `Music`
   3. Keep Algorithm as it is
8. Go to Settings and find `Identifier`. Copy & paste it into config.py => auth0_config['API_AUDIENCE'] (i.e. replace `"Music"`)

#### Create Roles & Permissions

1. Before creating `Roles & Permissions`, you need to `Enable RBAC` in your API (API => Click on your API Name => Settings = Enable RBAC => Save)
2. Also, check the button `Add Permissions in the Access Token`.
3. First, create a new Role under `Users and Roles` => `Roles` => `Create Roles`
4. Give it a descriptive name like `Casting Assistant`.
5. Go back to the API Tab and find your newly created API. Click on Permissions.
6. Create & assign all needed permissions accordingly
7. After you created all permissions this app needs, go back to `Users and Roles` => `Roles` and select the role you recently created.
8. Under `Permissions`, assign all permissions you want this role to have.

# 

### Auth0 to use existing API

If you want to access the real, temporary API, bearer tokens for all 3 roles are included in the `config.py` file.

## Existing Roles

They are 3 Roles with distinct permission sets:

1. Casting Assistant:

- GET /actors (view:actors): Can see all actors
- GET /movies (view:movies): Can see all movies

1. Casting Director (everything from Casting Assistant plus)

- POST /actors (create:actors): Can create new Actors
- PATCH /actors (edit:actors): Can edit existing Actors
- DELETE /actors (delete:actors): Can remove existing Actors from database
- PATCH /movies (edit:movies): Can edit existing Movies

1. Exectutive Dircector (everything from Casting Director plus)

- POST /movies (create:movies): Can create new Movies
- DELETE /movies (delete:movies): Can remove existing Motives from database

In your API Calls, add them as Header, with `Authorization` as key and the `Bearer token` as value. Don´t forget to also prepend `Bearer` to the token (seperated by space).

For example: (Bearer token for `Executive Director`)

```
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IkpJTWdXaW5pM2U0bzZsSDlnQTExWiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Rldi1xZ3pkcDV2bS5ldS5hdXRoMC5jb20vIiwic3ViIjoiYXV0aDB8NWYyZWM2ZGIyNmI3YzYwMDNkNDNiNTY5IiwiYXVkIjoiTXVzaWMiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTg3MjAyMTMsImV4cCI6MTU5ODcyNzQxMywiYXpwIjoiZzFTdmdMcFJONnNqOEEwWFEyajJpamVpQU9idTBTMG4iLCJzY29wZSI6IiIsInBlcm1pc3Npb25zIjpbImNyZWF0ZTphY3RvcnMiLCJjcmVhdGU6bW92aWVzIiwiZGVsZXRlOmFjdG9ycyIsImRlbGV0ZTptb3ZpZXMiLCJlZGl0OmFjdG9ycyIsImVkaXQ6bW92aWVzIiwicmVhZDphY3RvcnMiLCJyZWFkOm1vdmllcyJdfQ.IYwsBk82ULVotpr0rKCrY2Ai4ql166ohr6buw5fDrGkp3Jw6OTb_x7CA0gyfRQCMhZdQgEsd-nBVH8GiAy7eLH_NLrHon302R8dcPoCDetB04TUOHkicJoN7XA1GmtqC1OrtSkxRDXqbjfYqPq6xcsOZOewlpSgTIUER-AhcNdoSo1L3XfcYEcIrOlYZhgSTdx5Vw5j1bIJ15QTjlA1qEarN_siMPB-kJU8FAJ4iMq4UhYvKS-PRHhZGsvWSTPQCzH8xadwNIqmBvR6C0sljOl4CJFAcpokuQJJf6DSFWkdb-tBx8dLEVZ0cwvNZq40W7a5g7Q0dW7_bjoPnNLHRmA"
